  <p>  The Tequestas were a tribe of Native Americans who lived in what is now called Miami. Another tribe of Native Americans also lived there, they are called the Mayaimi. The name of the city
  Miami actually comes from the Mayaimi River, which was named after that tribe. In the 1800s, Miami was seen as a city of growth and prosper. In fact, when Florida was in a drought, Miami was the only 
  place that produced suffecient crops. World War 2 and the Cuban Missile crises caused many more people to live in Miami.

  <p>  A huge chunck of our history has to do with the Spanish people and the Native Americans.  Juan Ponce de León went to current day Miami, and recorded the name was Chequescha. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés and his men 
  went to Miami to look for his shipwrecked son. While he didn't find them, he set up a few missions in the area. With the Europeans coming to Miami, it led the Native American to catch many diseases. 
  The Spanish people sent two ships that the Natives could use to migrate to Havana, however the illness struck bad at that time. Most of their population had crumbled.

  <br>
  While that is our history, we do our very best to honor the Native Americans who first inhabited Miami.
