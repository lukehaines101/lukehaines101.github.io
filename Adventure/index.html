<h1>Arriving at the Grand Canyon</h1>
<h2>September 21, 2020</h2>
<p>I started the day at home in my bed, and I ended the day at a hotel overlooks the Grand Canyon. 
I went in a limo to the airport so I could look for the secret treasure in the Grand Canyon. I got to my hotel, which was
named "Grand Canyon Village", around 5:00 PM and here I am now. This is a list of important stuff they told me to bring:
 water, food, treasure clues, sunscreen, and my swimsuit. The treasure
clues were found in the envelope sent to me.
It's been a crazy day, but I only know one thing. I am looking for treasure. They call this the "Gateway to wonder", so it must
it's a gateway to the treasure. </p>

<h1>Looking for Clues</h1>
<h2>September 22, 2020</h2>
<p>I woke up today with a mission. The first clue said, "The noise that monkeys make will lead you on." I did some research and
it turns out there is an "Ooh Aah" trail in the Canyon. On my way there I crossed a skywalk called "The Grand Canyon Skywalk".
I strongly believe in the saying, "Always take the scenic route," which means always go the way that will give you the best
views. I hiked into the Canyon and I got to Ooh Aah point. One the back of the sign it said, "Water throughout the fall will cause you to find 
what you are looking for." I realized that the treasure must be behind the waterfall. It was getting late, so I had to go the next day.
