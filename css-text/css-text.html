Monkey is a common name that may refer to groups or species of mammals, in part,
 the simians of infraorder Simiiformes. The term is applied descriptively to groups
  of primates, such as families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. Many 
  monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live 
  primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are also active during the day 
  (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old
  World monkeys of Catarrhini.
