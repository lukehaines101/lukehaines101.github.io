<div id="style1">
When tectonic plates smash into each other, they push the Earth’s 
crust higher and higher, forming mountains. Some mountain ranges,
like the Himalayas, are still growing. Others, like the Appalachians, saw
their heyday hundreds of millions of years ago and have been
weathering away ever since. Volcanoes also form mountains and 
periodically erupt – scraping clear the landscape.
On a mountain, weather and the organisms that live there rapidly 
change as elevation increases. As temperatures get colder, tree species 
change, and then become scarcer before disappearing entirely. At the 
top there may be nothing but snow and ice. But even these bleak 
landscapes are home to a diverse array of plants and animals adapted 
for that environment.
Until recently, mountain habitats have been largely protected because 
of their inaccessibility. As people have moved into the mountains to 
live, for recreation and to obtain valuable resources such as timber,
 mountain ecosystems around the world have been subject to degradation and destruction.
