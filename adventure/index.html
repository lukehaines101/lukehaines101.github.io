<h1 style="color:blue;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center">Arriving at the Grand Canyon</h1>
<h2 style="color:red;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center">Day 1</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri">I started the day at home in my bed, and I ended the day at a hotel overlooks the Grand Canyon. 
I went in a limo to the airport so I could look for the secret treasure in the Grand Canyon. I got to my hotel, which was
named "Grand Canyon Village", around 5:00 PM and here I am now. 
This is a list of important stuff I brought:
<ul style="font-family:Calibri">
<li>Water</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Treasure Clues</li>
<li>Sunscreen</li>
<li>Swimsuit</li>
</ul>
 <p style="font-family:Calibri">The treasure clues were found in the envelope sent to me.
It's been a crazy day, but I only know one thing. I am looking for treasure. They call this the "Gateway to wonder", so it must
it's a gateway to the treasure. </p>

<h1 style="color:blue;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center">Looking for Clues</h1>
<h2 style="color:red;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center">Day 2</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri">I woke up today with a mission. The first clue said, "The noise that monkeys make will lead you on." I did some research and
it turns out there is an "Ooh Aah" trail in the Canyon. On my way there I crossed a skywalk called "The Grand Canyon Skywalk".
I strongly believe in the saying, "Always take the scenic route," which means always go the way that will give you the best
views. I hiked into the Canyon and I got to Ooh Aah point. One the back of the sign it said, "Water throughout the fall will cause you to find 
what you are looking for." I realized that the treasure must be behind the waterfall. It was getting late, so I had to go the next day.

<h1 style="color:blue;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center"> Treasure </h1>
<h2 style="color:red;font-family:Calibri;text-align:center">Day 3</h2>
<p style="font-family:Calibri"> The next day I went down to the bottom of the canyon on the Bright Angel Trail. There was a warning sign saying,
"Use caution near the edge," which was a warning to make sure you don't fall in the Canyon. I borrowed a raft from the Colorado
River Rafting building at the bottom of the Canyon. I went to the main waterfall I knew, Havasu Falls. I knew there must be a secret
room behind it, so I went straigth through it. I was soaked and spitting water everywhere, but I saw the room where the treasure was.
I opened the secret door and there it was.... The Treasure was right in front of me. There were countless items of jewelry, gold,
and old historic Native American treasure. I took it all and I am planning to donate it all to a museum.
